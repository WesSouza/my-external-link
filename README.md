# My External Link

To easily create a website that links to another website, follow these steps:

1. Create a [free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you don't have
   one (once you get to the "The home for all developers — including you."
   screen, come back to this guide).
2. ["Fork" this project](https://github.com/WesSouza/my-external-link/fork),
   which will create a copy on your GitHub.
3. On your copy, click the "link.txt" file.
4. Click the pencil icon on the top right of the file. You can also press E on
   the keyboard.
5. Change the URL to your link URL and click the green "Commit changes" at the
   bottom of the page.
6. Create a [free Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup) if you don't have
   one. You can click "Continue with GitHub" and authorize it (once you get to
   the "Let's build something new." screen, come back to this guide).
7. [Create a new Project](https://vercel.com/new) on Vercel. If you see a red
   error appear, click "Select a Git Namespace", then "Add GitHub Account".

    URL.
